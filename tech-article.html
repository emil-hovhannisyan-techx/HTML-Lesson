            Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong: Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam. Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island. And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island.
            Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our Nation.
            As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.
            But always will our whole Nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.
            No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
            I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.
            Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.
            With confidence in our armed forces with the unbounding determination of our people we will gain the inevitable triumph so help us God.
            I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire
            NOTE: Less than 24 hours after the reciept of the first news of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the President drove to the Capitol to deliever the foregoing message to a joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The President spoke grimly for six and a half

            <h2>World War 2</h2>
            <p>
                World War II or the Second World War (1 September 1939 - 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers. 
                Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. 
                Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. 
                World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of 70 to 85 million people, more than half of whom were civilians.
                Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. 
                After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for war crimes.

            <h2>In the age of social media, we're living through a communications revolution. But this isn't the first one, nor is it the first time cats have been at the centre of social change.</h2>
            <p>
                It is a fundamental law of media history: as soon as a new communications technology emerges, people will use it to make pictures of cats.
                And those cat pictures show not only the special relationship between humans and their pets, but the changing ways that humans relate to one another.
                Cat memes in their modern form date back to the 1990s, when email first allowed bored office workers and friends to message each other funny felines. 
                The cats jumped from there to social media as the web developed, where viral videos like Keyboard Cat and memes such as Grumpy Cat bloomed across platforms.
                Demand for this content was so high that entire websites like ICanHasCheezburger sprung up to showcase the best e-cats, aggregating popular pet videos and cat memes.
